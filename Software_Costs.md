Introduction to Software engineering course from London University :

I - SOFTWARE COSTS

   ➙ software costs often control and determin the full computer system costs
   ➙ software costs on the Pc are often greater than Pc hardware costs
   ➙ software cost + hardware cost = computer system cost, the software cost has more effect on the computer system cost
   ➙ software costs more to maintain than it does to develop
   ➙ systems with a long life, maintenance may be several times development costs
   ➙ software engineering concerned with cost-effective software development and good to high performance quality

II - SOFTWARE PRODUCTS :

    1 Generic Products :
     - Stand alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them. (Graphics, Programs, CAD software, software with specific markets such as appointments systems for dentists)
     - The specification of what the software should do is owned by the developer, and decisions on the software change also made by the developer.

    2 Customized Products :
     - Software that is specially made by a specific customer to meet their own needs. (Embedded control systems, air traffic control software, traffic monitoring systems)
     - The specification of what the software should do is owned by the customer, and they make decisions on software changes are required.

III - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING :
    ➙ Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification,
       through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use.

    1 Engineering Discipline
     - Using appropriate theories and methods to solve problems bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints.

    2 Software Aspects
     - Not just technical processof development. Also project management and the development of tools, methods... etc, to support software production

IIII - IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING :
    ➙ More and more, individuals and societies rely to advanced software systems. We need to be able to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly.

    ➙ It is usualy cheaper, in the long run to use software engineering methods and technics for software system rather than just write the code as if it was a personnal programming project.
       For most types of systems, the majority of costs are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use.
